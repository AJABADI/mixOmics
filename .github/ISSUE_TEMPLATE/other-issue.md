By submitting this issue/request, I confirm that:

1. I am aware that for analysis help I can refer to [Discourse](https://mixomics-users.discourse.group/) to see if my question is already answered or to submit a new one.

2. I am aware that if I get certain behaviour only using my data and not mixOmics datasets, it is best to send a fully confidential email with the code and (possibly a subset of) the data that reproduce the error to the following email (changing `[at]` and `[dot]` to `@` and `.`): mixomics[at]math[dot]univ-toulouse[dot]fr

3. I have checked that I have the latest version installed, as described [here](https://github.com/mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics/tree/RELEASE_3_9#installation).

4. I have searched the [live NEWS file](https://github.com/mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics/blob/devel/NEWS.md) to see if it has been fixed in `devel` already. If so, I tried the latest `devel` version
