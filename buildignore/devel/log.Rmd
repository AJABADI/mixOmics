Q2:
if Y containts one variable, a vector of Q^2 values else a list with a matrix of Q^2 values for each Y-variable. Note that in the specific case of an sPLS model, it is better to have a look at the Q2.total criterion, only applies to object inherited from "pls", and "spls"
```

```{latex}
Q2.total	
a vector of Q^2-total values for models with 1, â€¦ ,ncomp components, only applies to object inherited from "pls", and "spls"
```

```{latex}
Chavent, Marie and Patouille, Brigitte (2003). Calcul des coefficients de regression et du PRESS en regression PLS1. Modulad n, 30 1-11. (this is the formula we use to calculate the Q2 in perf.pls and perf.spls)
