## 
## vignette build is breaking
## it is due to changes to devel and Handbook
## the Hanbook changes did create a successful handbook build
## but it seems like the same changes are breaking the vignette
## we should gather all these changes and build the Handbook and the package at the same time on every change
## we should also increase the examples / unit tests
## then we can push to orihin and upstream
## we can also modularise the handbook changes
