\arguments{
\item{keepX}{A list of same length as X.  Each entry is the number of
variables to select in each of the blocks of X for each component. By
default all variables are kept in the model.}

\item{keepY}{Only if Y is provided. Each entry is the number of variables to
select in each of the blocks of Y for each component.}
}
\value{
\code{block.spls} returns an object of class \code{"block.spls"}, a
list that contains the following components:

\item{X}{the centered and standardized original predictor matrix.}
\item{indY}{the position of the outcome Y in the output list X.}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components included in the model for each block.}
\item{mode}{the algorithm used to fit the model.} \item{keepX}{Number of
variables used to build each component of each block} \item{keepY}{Number of
variables used to build each component of Y} \item{variates}{list containing
the variates of each block of X.} \item{loadings}{list containing the
estimated loadings for the variates.} \item{names}{list containing the names
to be used for individuals and variables.} \item{nzv}{list containing the
zero- or near-zero predictors information.} \item{iter}{Number of iterations
of the algorthm for each component} \item{explained_variance}{Percentage of
explained variance for each component and each block}

\description{
Integration of multiple data sets measured on the same samples or
observations, with variable selection in each data set, ie. N-integration.
The method is partly based on Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis.

\details{
\code{block.spls} function fits a horizontal sPLS model with a specified
number of components per block). An outcome needs to be provided, either by
\code{Y} or by its position \code{indY} in the list of blocks \code{X}.
Multi (continuous)response are supported. \code{X} and \code{Y} can contain
missing values. Missing values are handled by being disregarded during the
cross product computations in the algorithm \code{block.pls} without having
to delete rows with missing data. Alternatively, missing data can be imputed
prior using the \code{nipals} function.

The type of algorithm to use is specified with the \code{mode} argument.
Four PLS algorithms are available: PLS regression \code{("regression")}, PLS
canonical analysis \code{("canonical")}, redundancy analysis
\code{("invariant")} and the classical PLS algorithm \code{("classic")} (see
References and \code{?pls} for more details).

Note that our method is partly based on sparse Generalised Canonical
Correlation Analysis and differs from the MB-PLS approaches proposed by
Kowalski et al., 1989, J Chemom 3(1), Westerhuis et al., 1998, J Chemom,
12(5) and sparse variants Li et al., 2012, Bioinformatics 28(19); Karaman et
al (2014), Metabolomics, 11(2); Kawaguchi et al., 2017, Biostatistics.

Variable selection is performed on each component for each block of
\code{X}, and for \code{Y} if specified, via input parameter \code{keepX}
and \code{keepY}.

Note that if \code{Y} is missing and \code{indY} is provided, then variable
selection on \code{Y} is performed by specifying the input parameter
directly in \code{keepX} (no \code{keepY} is needed).
