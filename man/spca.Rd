\usage{
spca(
  X,
  ncomp = 2,
  center = TRUE,
  scale = TRUE,
  keepX = rep(ncol(X), ncomp),
  max.iter = 500,
  tol = 1e-06,
  logratio = "none",
  multilevel = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a numeric matrix (or data frame) which provides the data for the
principal components analysis. It can contain missing values.}

\item{ncomp}{Integer, if data is complete \code{ncomp} decides the number of
components and associated eigenvalues to display from the \code{pcasvd}
algorithm and if the data has missing values, \code{ncomp} gives the number
of components to keep to perform the reconstitution of the data using the
NIPALS algorithm. If \code{NULL}, function sets \code{ncomp = min(nrow(X),
ncol(X))}}

\item{center}{(Default=TRUE) Logical, whether the variables should be
shifted to be zero centered. Alternatively, a vector of length equal the
number of columns of \code{X} can be supplied. The value is passed to
\code{\link{scale}}.}

\item{scale}{(Default=TRUE) Logical indicating whether the variables should be
scaled to have unit variance before the analysis takes place.}

\item{keepX}{numeric vector of length ncomp, the number of variables to keep
in loading vectors. By default all variables are kept in the model. See
details.}

\item{max.iter}{Integer, the maximum number of iterations in the NIPALS
algorithm.}

\item{tol}{Positive real, the tolerance used in the NIPALS algorithm.}

\item{logratio}{one of ('none','CLR'). Specifies the log ratio
transformation to deal with compositional values that may arise from
specific normalisation in sequencing data. Default to 'none'}

\item{multilevel}{sample information for multilevel decomposition for
repeated measurements.}
}
\value{
\code{spca} returns a list with class \code{"spca"} containing the
following components: \item{ncomp}{the number of components to keep in the
calculation.} \item{varX}{the adjusted cumulative percentage of variances
explained.} \item{keepX}{the number of variables kept in each loading
vector.} \item{iter}{the number of iterations needed to reach convergence
for each component.} \item{rotation}{the matrix containing the sparse
loading vectors.} \item{x}{the matrix containing the principal components.}
}
\description{
Performs a sparse principal components analysis to perform variable
selection by using singular value decomposition.
}
\details{
The calculation employs singular value decomposition of the (centered and
scaled) data matrix and LASSO to generate sparsity on the loading vectors.

\code{scale= TRUE} is highly recommended as it will help obtaining
orthogonal sparse loading vectors.

\code{keepX} is the number of variables to keep in loading vectors. The
difference between number of columns of \code{X} and \code{keepX} is the
degree of sparsity, which refers to the number of zeros in each loading
vector.

Note that \code{spca} does not apply to the data matrix with missing values.
The biplot function for \code{spca} is not available.

According to Filzmoser et al., a ILR log ratio transformation is more
appropriate for PCA with compositional data. Both CLR and ILR are valid.

Logratio transform and multilevel analysis are performed sequentially as
internal pre-processing step, through \code{\link{logratio.transfo}} and
\code{\link{withinVariation}} respectively.

Logratio can only be applied if the data do not contain any 0 value (for
count data, we thus advise the normalise raw data with a 1 offset). For ILR
transformation and additional offset might be needed.

\examples{
data(liver.toxicity)
spca.rat <- spca(liver.toxicity$gene, ncomp = 3, keepX = rep(50, 3))
spca.rat

## variable representation
plotVar(spca.rat, cex = 1)
\dontrun{
plotVar(spca.rat,style="3d")
}

## samples representation
plotIndiv(spca.rat, ind.names = liver.toxicity$treatment[, 3],
          group = as.numeric(liver.toxicity$treatment[, 3]))

\dontrun{
plotIndiv(spca.rat, cex = 0.01,
col = as.numeric(liver.toxicity$treatment[, 3]),style="3d")

## example with multilevel decomposition and CLR log ratio transformation
data("diverse.16S")
spca.res = spca(X = diverse.16S$data.TSS, ncomp = 5,
logratio = 'CLR', multilevel = diverse.16S$sample)
plot(spca.res)
plotIndiv(spca.res, ind.names = FALSE, group = diverse.16S$bodysite, title = '16S diverse data',
