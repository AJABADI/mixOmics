\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class \code{MultiAssayExperiment} or similar.
See Details.}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix (or data frame) which provides the data for the
principal components analysis. It can contain missing values.
Alternatively, name of an assay from \code{data}.}

\item{Y}{Numeric vector or matrix of responses (for multi-response models),
or name of such an \code{assay} or
\code{colData} from \code{data}. \code{NA}s are allowed.}

\item{formula}{A \code{formula} object of form \code{LHS ~ RHS} where 
\code{LHS} and \code{RHS} are either matrices or assay names (no quotation)
 from \code{data}. 
 \code{X} and \code{Y} must be \code{NULL} when \code{formula} is used. 
 See Details.}

\item{...}{Aguments passed to the generic.}

\item{keepX}{Numeric vector of length \code{ncomp}, the number of variables
to keep in \eqn{X}-loadings. By default all variables are kept in the model.}

to keep in \eqn{Y}-loadings. By default all variables are kept in the model.}
}
\value{
\code{spls} returns an object of class \code{"spls"}, a list that
contains the following components:

\item{X}{the centered and standardized original predictor matrix.}
\item{Y}{the centered and standardized original response vector or matrix.}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components included in the model.}
\item{mode}{the algorithm used to fit the model.} \item{keepX}{number of
\eqn{X} variables kept in the model on each component.} \item{keepY}{number
of \eqn{Y} variables kept in the model on each component.}

containing the estimated loadings for the \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} variates.}

variables.} \item{tol}{the tolerance used in the iterative algorithm, used
for subsequent S3 methods} \item{iter}{Number of iterations of the algorthm
for each component} \item{max.iter}{the maximum number of iterations, used
for subsequent S3 methods} \item{nzv}{list containing the zero- or near-zero
predictors information.} \item{scale}{whether scaling was applied per
predictor.} \item{logratio}{whether log ratio transformation for relative
proportion data was applied, and if so, which type of transformation.}
\item{explained_variance}{amount of variance explained per component (note
that contrary to PCA, this amount may not decrease as the aim of the method
is not to maximise the variance, but the covariance between data sets).}
\item{input.X}{numeric matrix of predictors in X that was input, before any
saling / logratio / multilevel transformation.} \item{mat.c}{matrix of
coefficients from the regression of X / residual matrices X on the
X-variates, to be used internally by \code{predict}.}

\description{
Function to perform sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS). The sPLS approach
combines both integration and variable selection simultaneously on two data
sets in a one-step strategy.
}
\details{
\code{spls} function fit sPLS models with \eqn{1, \ldots ,}\code{ncomp}
components. Multi-response models are fully supported. The \code{X} and
\code{Y} datasets can contain missing values.

The type of algorithm to use is specified with the \code{mode} argument.
Four PLS algorithms are available: PLS regression \code{("regression")}, PLS
canonical analysis \code{("canonical")}, redundancy analysis
\code{("invariant")} and the classical PLS algorithm \code{("classic")} (see
References and \code{?pls} for more details).

The estimation of the missing values can be performed by the reconstitution
of the data matrix using the \code{nipals} function. Otherwise, missing
values are handled by casewise deletion in the \code{spls} function without
having to delete the rows with missing data.

logratio transform and multilevel analysis are performed sequentially as
internal pre-processing step, through \code{\link{logratio.transfo}} and
\code{\link{withinVariation}} respectively.

Multilevel sPLS enables the integration of data measured on two different
data sets on the same individuals. This approach differs from multilevel
sPLS-DA as the aim is to select subsets of variables from both data sets
that are highly positively or negatively correlated across samples. The
approach is unsupervised, i.e. no prior knowledge about the sample groups is
included.
